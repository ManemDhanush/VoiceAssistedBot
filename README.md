A Virtual assistant for differently abled people

As we live in a Digital world, we get to see a ton of new data being added and being accesed by the people through their smartphones or laptops or any of the gadgets which connects to the internet

It becomes hard for the differently abled prople to access the internet and surf through the web

We have virtual assistants in the market but those assistants only read out the data present in the first link

If the person is not satisfied he/she cannot change it through voice. He/She should manually go through the link

Our VirtualAssistedBot ie 'Anu' can surf through the web and reads out all the links, If the user is intrested in a particular link He/She can navigate through it without manually navigating

Along with Web search 'Anu' can provide various services like

playing a song

read out a joke

read out the present time

wikipedia search and etc...
